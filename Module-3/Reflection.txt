6. Crumple the Paper Tiger...

From personal experience, I get boggled down in technique, semantics, optimization, doing something the "right" way, etc. It is a form of procrastination and self-sabotage. I would rather stress out and beat myself about doing something wrong instead of experimenting and dealing with stumbles along the way. I need to understand that failing is not a way to give myself an excuse to stop, but an opportunity to learn from my mistakes and gain knowledge.
